[454] In the workplace additional inhalative/oral intake needs to be taken into consideration. [419] Respiratory tract In the workplace NaCl can be inhaled as dust or as an aerosol from solutions. [419] Absorption via the respiratory tract is expected but information on this is not available. [99983] Studies on volunteers showed that a part of particles inhaled are deposited in the upper airways. [220] These are at least in part subjected to the mucociliary clearance in the respiratory tract and are carried over into the gastrointestinal tract and absorbed there. [99999] Skin The possibility of absorption via the skin (transepidermal, not transfollicular) has been demonstrated in studies using NaCl solution on guinea pigs. [220] However, uptake through the skin is not considered to be a relevant intake pathway. [419] Gastrointestinal tract NaCl which reaches the gastrointestinal tract is absorbed rapidly and effectively. [454]'}, {'drnr': '5002', 'text': 'TOXIC EFFECTS Main toxic effects Acute: Mild irritation to the mucous membranes and the skin, [220] gastrointestinal and metabolic disturbances following oral intake of very high doses with secundary effects to the functions of organs [419, 454] Chronic: Damage to the skin and mucous membranes following very high exposure, influence on the blood pressure [419] Acute toxicity The ions of NaCl play an essential role in the organism and can be tolerated by humans in high doses. The potential to cause local irritation is also only minor. [99983] An isotonic NaCl solution (0.9%) is tolerated without any problems by the mucous membranes of the eye. NaCl solutions from 0.9% - 10% also do not have any effect on the permeability of the cornea (below 0.9% the permeability is increased). There is slight stinging in the eye when the NaCl concentration exceeds that of the tear liquids. [7979] 20% NaCl solution was not irritating in a test on rabbits’ eyes (irritation index 0 on a scale up to 110). [419] Crystalline NaCl (instillation of 10 or 100 mg) in tests on rabbits’ eyes caused mild or moderate irritation. [419, 220] On the skin the crystalline salt caused either no or only very minor irritation. [419] This was confirmed by tests on the skin of rabbits (mild irritation following contact with 50 or 500 mg for 24 hours). [220] Experience and physiological knowledge indicates that NaCl does not cause sensitization. There is no danger of poisoning following application to the skin (dermal LD50 on rabbits of > 10 g/kg bw). Exposure to dust or mist from aqueous solutions could lead to slight irritation in the nose and throat but there is no acute danger. [419] The 1h LC50 for NaCl in an inhalative test on rats was above 42 000 mg/m³ (no information on symptoms or findings). [419, 438] NaCl was well tolerated in high doses as oral intake with foods. A salty taste of solutions was noticed at NaCl concentrations above about 550 mg/l. [220] Swallowing of high doses of the crystalline salt or concentrated solutions can cause nausea, vomiting, strong thirst, irritation to the oral mucosa and possibly even damage to the mucous membranes in the gastrointestinal tract. [419] NaCl solutions caused vomiting starting at concentrations of about 10 g/l. [220] Systemic effects caused by excessive intake of NaCl were disturbances in the electrolyte balances. The increased concentration in the blood led to an increase in the blood volume with simultaneous dehydration of the tissue and disturbances of the kidney function (reduction in the excretion of liquids). This could lead to muscle weakness, congestion in the blood vessels and in the brain, changes in blood coagulation, increase in blood pressure, further cardiovascular reactions and nervous disorders. In serious cases there could be collapse, cramps, cerebral edema and pulmonary edema. [454, 419] The first toxic effects in healthy adults are supposed to appear following the intake of 8.2 g/kg bw, [454] but toxic effects have also been stated following much lower doses (0.5 - 1 g/kg bw). Oral LD50 values of 3 - 5.8 mg/kg bw were found in animal studies on rats and mice. [220, 419] Chronic toxicity From occupational exposure it is known that prolonged and repeated skin contact with crystalline NaCl or concentrated solutions can cause ulcerous skin inflammation. These effects were seen in workers in salt mines or in those who had constant contact with brine (during the conservation of meat and fish). [419] Workers in salt mines suffered from the formation of ulcers on the mucous membranes in the nose through to perforation of the nasal septum. [220] Information on the conditions which caused this local damage is not available [99983] but the exposure must have been massive. [99999] There are also indications that high occupational exposure can influence the blood pressure. A cross-sectional study was carried out on “salt workers” who were either inhalatively exposed to dry NaCl dust (n=474) or handled NaCl solution (brine) (n=284). The exposure to the dry dust was 376 mg/m³ for an average of 8.7 years while the workers who handled brine worked there for around 11.4 years. The “salt workers” exposed to dust showed significantly higher blood pressure than those who worked with brine. In addition the prevalence of those suffering from pathologically high blood pressure (>139 mm Hg/> 90 mm Hg) was significantly higher. A significant reduction of the blood pressure was achieved by wearing respiratory protection. [419] Under the current conditions in workplaces, the exposure is so low that hardly noticeable in the comparison of the intake with food. [99999] The usual intake of NaCl by adults in Europe in their food is estimated to be 8 - 10 g/d. When animals received NaCl with the feed or with drinking water, damage was seen only at very high dosages. Rats which received feed containing 4% NaCl for 2 years, showed inflammation and ulcerous lesions in the stomach, sometimes also damage to the kidneys and arteries. Dogs tolerated up to 12% NaCl in their feed for the whole of their lives without any influence on body weight, blood pressure or the biochemical parameters which characterize the function of the organs. [220] Reproductive toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity Reproductive toxicity: There are no indications that NaCl has any developmental toxic effects or influences fertility in humans. Epidemiological or animal studies on this using standardized methods are not available. In a limited study on rats, the offspring showed increased blood pressure when the mother received high NaCl doses in their drinking water (approx. 2 g/kg bw) during pregnancies. [419, 220] Mutagenicity: There are no indications that NaCl has any mutagenic effects. NaCl solutions of very low concentrations have been used as solvents for test substances in a variety of mutagenicity tests (because of their inactivity). Positive reactions found in isolated cases on cultivated mammalian cells or in microorganisms were probably caused by osmotic effects and are not attributable to mutagenicity. [419] Carcinogenicity: There are no indications that NaCl has any carcinogenic effects. [99983] However, a higher incidence of stomach cancer was seen in some populations which had a higher consumption of salt. In an animal study, the oral administration of high NaCl doses following the administration of a carcinogen (e.g. N-methyl-N’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine) was shown to lead to a higher incidence of tumors in the stomach and windpipe. [419, 220] There is a need to investigate the possibility of tumor promoting effects resulting from inhalative exposure to NaCl aerosols. [7619] Biotransformation and excretion Sodium and chloride ions are important minerals/electrolytes which are maintained at high concentrations in the organism and comprehensively integrated into physiological processes. [99983] The excretion takes place mainly with the urine and also with the sweat and feces. Because of the physiological importance of the electrolytes, the excretion via the kidneys involves a homeostatic mechanism which includes re-absorption in various functional parts of the kidneys. The regulation of the excretion of Na ions is closely connected with the regulation of the blood pressure. Irrespective of this, sweating can also lead to a substantial excretion of NaCl.

If irritation appears: Arrange for medical treatment. [419] Respiratory tract Whenever irritation or complaints appear: Whilst protecting yourself remove the casualty from the hazardous area and take him to the fresh air. Arrange medical treatment. [419] Swallowing If concentrated solutions or large amounts of the salt have been swallowed: Rinse the mouth and spit the fluids out. If the casualty is conscious have him drink 1 glass of water (ca 200 ml). Spontaneous vomiting is likely: hold the head of the casualty low with the body in a prone position in order to avoid aspiration. Arrange medical treatment. [419, 99999] Information for physicians - Symptoms of acute poisoning: Eyes/Skin: slight to moderate irritation (mainly due to the crystalline salt), mostly no irritation on the skin, absorptive effects not expected [220, 419] Inhalation: salty taste, mild irritation in the nose and throat, systemic effects unlikely [419] Ingestion: caused by high doses of the salt/concentrated solutions: vomiting, nausea, thirst, irritation to the oral mucosa, possibly irritation to the mucous membranes in the stomach and intestine, systemic effects Absorption: caused by very high doses: disturbances in electrolyte balances (hypernatremia) -> dehydration of the tissues, disturbances of the kidney function, muscular weakness, congestion in organs, increase in blood pressure, disturbances of blood coagulation, nervous disorders, in extreme cases collapse, cramps, cerebral edema, pulmonary edema. [454, 419] - Medical advice: Rinse again thoroughly if the solid or concentrated solutions have gotten into the eye. Consult an ophthalmologist if the irritation persists. Following skin contact, thorough rinsing is normally sufficient. [419] Irritated areas can be treated in the usual way. [99999] If massive amounts of dust are inhaled, take the casualty into the fresh air and observe him. Treat symptomatically as necessary. [419] Inhalation of water vapor could be helpful to treat irritation in the nose/throat, reduce the salt concentration on mucous membranes and help remove the salt more quickly. [99999] The swallowing of overdoses of NaCl as a salt or a concentrated solution mostly causes immediate vomiting. [419] In any case the casualty should be observed in hospital, at least for a short time. It is of primary concern to check the cardiovascular function (check of blood pressure), renal function, electrolyte balance and blood parameters. [454, 419] Recommendations Provide the physician information about the substance/product and treatment already administered. It needs to be taken into account that commercial products (such as road salt, salt for cattle) contain impurities or additives, so these can have stronger effects than those caused by NaCl alone.
